/*
Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

##
###
####
#####
######

/*
FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), 
print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are 
divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of 
programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)

/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a 
chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
